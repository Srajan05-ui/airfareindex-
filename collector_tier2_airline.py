"""
Tier 2 collector — airline direct booking-engine JSON endpoint, via
curl_cffi (TLS/browser-impersonating HTTP client, no headless browser).

This matches the pipeline you sketched:
    Python -> curl_cffi -> Airline JSON endpoint -> JSON -> Fare

WHY THIS FILE HAS NO REAL ENDPOINT URL IN IT YET
Every airline's search endpoint is different and undocumented (brief
§6.2: "these are internal endpoints, not published APIs... treat them as
Tier 2, apply the same politeness rules, and be prepared for them to
break"). I'm not going to guess or fabricate one -- a wrong URL/payload
either does nothing or hits the wrong endpoint. You find the real one
in about 10 minutes with your own browser's DevTools, and it's a skill
your team needs anyway for when it inevitably changes:

  HOW TO FIND IT (do this once per airline, re-check if it stops working):
    1. Open the airline's flight search page in Chrome, DevTools -> Network,
       filter to "Fetch/XHR".
    2. Run a normal search (route + date) as a real user would.
    3. Find the request that returns fares as JSON (usually named something
       like "search", "availability", "fare"). Click it.
    4. Right-click -> Copy -> Copy as cURL.
    5. Paste that curl command below in RAW_CURL_REFERENCE (as a comment,
       for the team's own reference -- do not commit real cookies/tokens).
    6. Translate the method, URL, headers and JSON body into the
       `build_request()` function below.

This keeps the actual request-shape decision with a human looking at a
real page, which is also the honest thing to do: these are the airline's
own JSON responses served to a normal browser search, not an
authentication bypass or a hidden API.

BEFORE RUNNING: this always checks robots.txt for the endpoint's domain
first (see robots_check.py) and refuses to proceed if disallowed.
